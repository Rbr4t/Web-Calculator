# JavaScript problems

1. You can't divide/ NaN + any operator or num works!
2. Pressing = button multiple times results unwanted answers:
  a) on * and / -> number gets smaller and return NaN.
  b) on - and + -> returns NaN.
3. When you have a number and press =, it should return the same number (not NaN).
4. When pressing multiple operators, it returns "can't divide by zero".
5. When deleting operator and when you try to change it, it returns NaN.
6. Code formatting is ugly
